This project is a secure platform for document upload, storage, and sharing, implemented as an Android mobile application built using Android Studio. It emphasizes data confidentiality and integrity using advanced encryption algorithms, digital signatures, and comprehensive security protocols. The system prevents unauthorized access and ensures that documents can be securely managed.

Features:

- Secure Upload and Storage: Users can upload documents securely, with robust encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) used to protect the data. The files are stored in AWS Cloud, ensuring scalable and reliable storage solutions.
- Digital Signatures: Documents are signed using the LDSS (Lightweight Digital Signature Scheme) to ensure authenticity and integrity, making it possible to verify the origin and contents of the documents.
- End-to-End Security: The platform employs end-to-end encryption to ensure data protection throughout its lifecycle.
- User Authentication: Secure authentication mechanisms are in place to verify user identities, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the documents.
- File Sharing: Users can securely share documents with others, with AES encryption ensuring that shared data remains confidential and intact.

System Components:

1) Secure Upload and Storage:
 - AES Encryption: Used to encrypt documents during upload and storage, ensuring data remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.
 - AWS Cloud Storage: Files are stored in AWS Cloud, providing reliable and scalable storage solutions.

2) Digital Signatures:
- LDSS: Implements digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of documents, ensuring they have not been tampered with.

3) End-to-End Security:
Ensures that data is encrypted at all stages, from upload to storage and sharing.

4) User Authentication:
Verifies user identities using secure authentication mechanisms, providing access control to sensitive documents.

5)File Sharing:
Allows secure sharing of documents using AES encryption, ensuring that only intended recipients can access the data.

6) Database Management:
Firebase: The database for managing user data and document metadata is kept in Firebase, offering real-time data synchronization and secure access control.

Platform:

The platform is an Android mobile application developed using Android Studio, providing a user-friendly interface for secure document management.

How to Use:

1) Upload Documents: Users can upload documents through the secure Android application interface, where they are encrypted using AES and stored in AWS Cloud.
2) Sign Documents: Documents are digitally signed using LDSS to ensure their authenticity.
3) Share Documents: Users can share documents securely through the Android application, with AES encryption protecting the data during transfer.
4) Access Control: Authentication mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can access and manage documents, with user data managed in Firebase.

Outcome:
A highly secure document management system that leverages AES encryption and LDSS for digital signatures, providing robust protection for sensitive information. The platform ensures secure upload, storage in AWS Cloud, and sharing of documents, with real-time database management in Firebase, making it suitable for environments where data security is critical.
